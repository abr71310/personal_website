Hi there!

This is the README to my personal website that I regularly maintain for the moment. (Feb 2015)

Languages This Website Uses: (in no order of importance)
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* PHP (contact form)

External Library uses:
* Font Awesome: http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/
* jQuery

Upcoming features:
* Blog support (WordPress plugin or otherwise)
* YouTube widget
* Aggregate Feed Update

Once I finish making my photography portfolio (required: DSLR), I will:
* Create a Gallery!
* Have lots of images for the Gallery!
* Probably create another slider-type-flex thing underneath the "quotes" section!

Things that are currently pissing me off:
* No Quora icon on my website. 
** This is because FontAwesome doesn't have a Quora icon (What gives?).
* CSS formatting is difficult, especially when you mix absolute & fixed positions.

Thanks for stopping by my Github! 
I know it's pretty barren -- but at least there's this!

Michael
