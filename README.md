Hi there!

This is the README to my personal website that I regularly maintain for the moment. (Mar 2016)

##Languages This Website Uses:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* PHP (contact form)

##External Library uses:
* Font Awesome: http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/
* jQuery

##Upcoming features:
* Blog support (WordPress plugin or otherwise)
* YouTube widget
* Aggregate Feed Update

##Even farther out:
* Create a Gallery!
* Have lots of images for the Gallery!
* Probably create another slider-type-flex thing underneath the "quotes" section!

##Things that are currently pissing me off:
* No Quora icon on my website. 
** This is because FontAwesome doesn't have a Quora icon (What gives?).
* CSS formatting is difficult, especially when you mix absolute & fixed positions.

##Changelog:

###March 3, 2016
* Fixed reCaptcha behaviour, once and for all (finally).
** Changed reCaptcha library to Google's official PHP-supported 1.0.0 version.
** Special thanks to [this tutorial](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-integrate-no-captcha-recaptcha-in-your-website--cms-23024) for writing a detailed solution to integrating Google reCaptcha.
* Profile picture update, since \#newbadgephotos
* Updated website summary & work profile

Thanks for stopping by my Github! 
I know it's pretty barren -- but at least there's this!

Michael
