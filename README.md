Hi there!

This is the README to my personal website that I regularly maintain for the moment. (Mar 2016)

##Languages This Website Uses:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* PHP (contact form)

##External Library uses:
* Font Awesome: http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/
* jQuery

##Upcoming features:
* Blog support (WordPress plugin or otherwise)
 * I started the blog, I just need time to make (or integrate) a widget that will enable easy re-use in the website.
* YouTube widget
* Aggregate Feed Update

##Even farther out:
* Create a Gallery! (kinda done?)
* Have lots of images for the Gallery! (need a better quality camera...)
* Probably create another slider-type-flex thing underneath the "quotes" section!
 * I know this is a "thing" already, but it's currently not "great" (at least not the way I envisioned a better one to look), but it's "good enough" for now.

##Things that are currently pissing me off:
* CSS formatting is difficult, especially when you mix absolute & fixed positions.
 * I should probably go back and remove the hacks in some areas - I over-indexed on a ton of CSS that I haven't used that much yet.
* With the architecture / design / layout of this site, it is difficult to add logos to a standard navbar row (or column) to make them more easily accessible.
 * It's also difficult to line them up properly with their relevant experience without completely rewriting the entire CSS or changing the design of the layout.

##Changelog:

###September 12, 2017
* Added new background photos for the landing page and the quotes are (since I finally started using my phone camera more).
* Introduced "Bootstrap", which came with other goodies like a photo carousel
* Created a photo carousel, which should be "not terrible" but this is draft 1 for that... so yeah.
 * Added a bunch of photos (7 total, including the original background/header photo)
* Fixed content on index.html regarding hobbies and overall "about" section.
* Updated the FontAwesome library to 4.7, since a new one is available.
 * Hey look, they finally added Quora!

###October 25, 2016
* Added logos for AGF, Blue Coat, Datalot, Riot Games, Audible, and Amazon, as well as the ability to click on them to scroll to their respective regions.
* Fixed a bug where, when scrolling, the navbar would prematurely appear, or stay hovering for too long.
 * This was due to a bug in the JavaScript that was written (that was surprisingly written over 1.5 years ago, and I don't remember much about).
* Changed contact information due to moving off of a deprecated username (due to password reuse concerns).
 * Removed some links for accounts no longer used, and added GitHub account (with updated username) since it's cool and hip to use a professional name.
* Replaced the Twitter feed with my personal one (which will be kept private for now, due to privacy concerns).
* Added another resume because "reasons" -- finding the website that does some pretty cool designs around user-generated fields is useful too!

###March 3, 2016
* Fixed reCaptcha behaviour, once and for all (finally).
 * Changed reCaptcha library to Google's official PHP-supported 1.0.0 version.
 * Special thanks to [this tutorial](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-integrate-no-captcha-recaptcha-in-your-website--cms-23024) for writing a detailed solution to integrating Google reCaptcha.
* Profile picture update, since \#newbadgephotos
* Updated website summary & work profile

Thanks for stopping by my Github! 
I know it's pretty barren -- but at least there's this!
