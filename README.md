Hi there!

This is the README to the website I'm maintaining right now.
Nothing major yet, but a roadmap!

Once I finish making my photography portfolio (required: DSLR), I will:
* Create a Gallery!
* Have lots of images for the Gallery!
* Probably create another slider-type-flex thing underneath the "quotes" section!

Thanks for stopping by my Github! 
I know it's pretty barren -- but at least there's this!

Michael
